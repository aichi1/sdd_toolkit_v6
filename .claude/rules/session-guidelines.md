# Session Guidelines

## Session Start (Quick Sync, ~3 min)
1. Read CLAUDE.md "Next Session Starter" section (30s)
2. `git status` + `git log -1` to verify state (30s)
3. Run tests if applicable (1 min)
4. Define today's goal in one sentence (30s)
5. Plan tasks with estimated times before coding (30s)

## Session End (Retrospective, ~5 min)
1. **Facts**: completed tasks, files changed, test state, commits
2. **Findings**: what worked (Keep), what didn't (Problem), new learnings (Discovery)
3. **Future**: update CLAUDE.md, write "Next Session Starter", note 1 improvement to try next time

## Retrospective Checklist
```
- Completion: __% (N/M tasks)
- Tests: __ pass / __ fail
- Keep: (1-3 items)
- Problem: (1-3 items)
- Discovery: (1-3 items)
- Try Next: (1 item)
- Resume from: (commit/state)
- First task next time: ___
```

## Anti-patterns
- Skipping retrospective (context loss next session)
- Abstract notes ("it was good") without specifics
- Spending >7 min on retrospective (diminishing returns)
